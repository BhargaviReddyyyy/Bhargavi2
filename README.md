This project analyzes and predicts bike-sharing demand using a rental dataset. Steps include preprocessing (handling nulls, duplicates), EDA (plots, heatmap), feature engineering (dummy variables, scaling), and regression modeling. RFE and VIF refine models, ensuring robust, interpretable predictions for rental optimization.
